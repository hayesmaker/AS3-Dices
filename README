OK Hai!

This is my AS3 Dice animations project.

Goals: Provide a dynamic and fast totally customisable Dice animation for use in games or whatever else you might want to throw dices for.

This project is uses:
Actionscript 3 - The language
Stage3D - Adobe's low level 3D api for offloading heavy maths calculations to the GPU.
Away3D - A nice high level 3d Framework so I don't have to learn the low level shit.
Jiglib - A physics engine ported to AS3.

Setup instructions:
Coming.
